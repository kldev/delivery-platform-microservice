# Delivery Platform

Event-driven microservices platform for managing deliveries, payments, external transactions and financial reconciliation.

The project demonstrates a distributed architecture built around **Kotlin, Java 25, Spring Boot, C#, ASP.NET Core, YARP, PostgreSQL and Apache Kafka**.

The main goal of the project is to demonstrate how independent microservices can cooperate through REST APIs and asynchronous Kafka events while maintaining clear domain boundaries.

---

## Architecture

The platform consists of several independent services:

                                                        PostgreSQL
```

Each service owns its domain and persistence model.

Communication is split into:

- *REST* — synchronous commands and queries
- *Kafka* — asynchronous domain/integration events
- *PostgreSQL* — persistent storage
- *YARP Gateway* — single HTTP entry point for client applications                         

---

## Services
### Delivery Service

Responsible for the delivery lifecycle.

A delivery goes through the following workflow:

```text

CREATED
   │
   ▼
CONFIRMED
   │
   ▼
ASSIGNED
   │
   ▼
PICKED_UP
   │
   ▼
IN_PROGRESS
   │
   ▼
DELIVERED
```

The service manages:

- deliveries
- drivers
- delivery state transitions
- delivery assignment
- pickup
- delivery start
- delivery completion

---

### Payment Service

Responsible for payment lifecycle and external transactions.

A payment can be accepted and later completed using an external transaction reported by a payment provider.

Example external transaction:

```json
{
  "paymentId": "690c5ba8-02c7-4f46-80f2-df9fa089260a",
  "transactionId": "TXT-690c5ba8-02c7-4f46-80f2-df9fa089260a",
  "amount": 7.0000,
  "provider": "K6-TEST"
}
```

The payment service stores external transactions and publishes events used by the reconciliation service.

---

###  Ledger Service

The Ledger Service provides financial ledger entries related to completed payments and deliveries.

It can be queried independently from the Payment and Delivery services.

---

### Reconciliation Service

The Reconciliation Service compares:

```text
Expected Amount
       │
       │
       ▼
External Transaction
       │
       ▼
Actual Amount
```

and determines whether the payment is correctly settled.

Possible reconciliation states include:
- RECONCILED
- DISCREPANCY

Example of a successful reconciliation:

```json
{
  "expectedAmount": 7.0000,
  "actualAmount": 7.0000,
  "currency": "PLN",
  "status": "RECONCILED",
  "difference": 0.0000
}
```

Example of a discrepancy:

```json
{
  "expectedAmount": 7.0000,
  "actualAmount": 9.0000,
  "currency": "PLN",
  "status": "DISCREPANCY",
  "difference": 2.0000
}
```

This makes the reconciliation flow capable of detecting situations where an external payment provider reports an amount different from the expected payment amount.

---

### End-to-End Flow

The main business flow implemented by the project is:

```text
Create Delivery
      │
      ▼
Confirm Delivery
      │
      │
      └──────────────► Payment created asynchronously
                              │
                              ▼
                       Accept Payment
                              │
                              ▼
                       Delivery Assigned
                              │
                              ▼
                         Pickup
                              │
                              ▼
                      Start Delivery
                              │
                              ▼
                    Complete Delivery
                              │
                              ▼
                         Ledger Entry
                              │
                              ▼
                 External Transaction
                              │
                              ▼
                       Reconciliation
                              │
                 ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                 ▼                         ▼
            RECONCILED                DISCREPANCY
```

The important part of the architecture is that the services do not need to synchronously call each other for every state transition.

For example:

```text
Delivery Service
      │
      │ DeliveryConfirmed
      ▼
     Kafka
      │
      ▼
Payment Service
      │
      │ PaymentCreated
      ▼
     Kafka
      │
      ▼
other consumers
```

This allows individual services to remain independently deployable and scalable.

---

### Technology Stack

Backend
- Kotlin
- Java 25
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data / JPA
- C#
- .NET
- ASP.NET Core

Kotlin and Java are used for Spring Boot based services, while the Payment service and gateway demonstrate the .NET/C# side of the platform.

---

### API Gateway

The project uses YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) as the API Gateway.

The gateway is responsible for routing external requests to individual microservices.

Example:

```text
/api/delivery/*       → Delivery Service
/api/payment/*        → Payment Service
/api/ledger/*         → Ledger Service
/api/reconciliation/* → Reconciliation Service
```
This gives clients a single entry point while keeping services internally independent.

---

### Messaging

**Apache Kafka** is used as the event backbone.

Kafka is responsible for asynchronous communication between services.

Typical events include concepts such as:

```text
DeliveryConfirmed
PaymentCreated
PaymentAccepted
DeliveryAssigned
DeliveryCompleted
ExternalTransactionReceived
PaymentReconciled
```

The exact event contracts are owned by the corresponding domains.

---

### Database

**PostgreSQL** is used as the primary relational database.

Each service is designed around its own persistence boundary rather than sharing domain tables between services.

This allows the services to evolve their schemas independently.

---

### API Documentation

The APIs are documented using **OpenAPI** and exposed through **Scalar**.

Scalar provides an interactive API documentation experience for testing and exploring the REST endpoints.

---

### REST API

The gateway exposes endpoints grouped by bounded context.

#### Delivery

```http
GET    /api/delivery/drivers
POST   /api/delivery/drivers

GET    /api/delivery/deliveries
POST   /api/delivery/deliveries

PUT    /api/delivery/deliveries/{id}/confirm
PUT    /api/delivery/deliveries/{id}/pickup
PUT    /api/delivery/deliveries/{id}/start
PUT    /api/delivery/deliveries/{id}/complete
```

#### Payment

```http
GET  /api/payment/payments
PUT  /api/payment/payments/{id}/accept

POST /api/payment/payments/external
```

#### Ledger

```http
GET /api/ledger/ledger-entries
```

#### Reconciliation

```
GET /api/reconciliation/reconciliations
```

---

### Reconciliation

The reconciliation process compares the expected payment amount with the amount reported by an external payment provider.

**Matching transaction**

```text
Expected: 7.00 PLN
Actual:   7.00 PLN

Difference: 0.00 PLN

Result:
RECONCILED
```

**Payment discrepancy**

```text
Expected: 7.00 PLN
Actual:   9.00 PLN

Difference: 2.00 PLN

Result:
DISCREPANCY
```

Example response:

```json
{
  "id": "045fd60e-f6cc-40d9-af06-6d20e07066fd",
  "deliveryId": "8bd6afc7-c6ac-4c01-823b-64752244c5f7",
  "settlementId": "992a4b11-0f61-48e1-aa63-2f0939bf9b9c",
  "paymentId": "16cd75aa-5136-46e6-a48d-4453ffd88e6d",
  "externalTransactionId": "TXT-16cd75aa-5136-46e6-a48d-4453ffd88e6d",
  "expectedAmount": 7.0000,
  "actualAmount": 9.0000,
  "currency": "PLN",
  "status": "DISCREPANCY",
  "difference": 2.0000,
  "createdAt": "2026-08-24T16:28:52.578363Z",
  "reconciledAt": "2026-08-24T16:28:53.655591Z"
}
```

---

### Load Testing

The project includes an end-to-end k6 scenario testing the complete business flow.

The test executes:

```text
Create Delivery
      ↓
Confirm Delivery
      ↓
Wait for Payment
      ↓
Accept Payment
      ↓
Wait for Assignment
      ↓
Pickup
      ↓
Start
      ↓
Complete
      ↓
Wait for Ledger
      ↓
Submit External Transaction
      ↓
Wait for Reconciliation
```

The current scenario uses:

```javascript
{
    executor: 'shared-iterations',
    vus: 50,
    iterations: 50,
    maxDuration: '2m'
}
```

This means the test executes **50 complete business flows using up to 50 virtual users**.

The test also verifies asynchronous processing by polling for:

- payment creation
- delivery assignment
- delivery completion
- ledger entries
- reconciliation results

---

### Load Test Scenarios

The external transaction amount is intentionally randomized:

```javascript
amount: Math.random() < 0.5
    ? 7.0000
    : 9.000
```

This produces two reconciliation scenarios.

**Successful settlement**

```text
Expected = 7 PLN
Actual   = 7 PLN
           ↓
       RECONCILED
```

**Payment discrepancy**

```text
Expected = 7 PLN
Actual   = 9 PLN
           ↓
       DISCREPANCY
```

This allows the load test to validate not only HTTP availability, but also actual business behavior across multiple services.

---

### Testing Strategy

The project combines several levels of testing:

```text
                 ┌──────────────────┐
                 │   Unit Tests     │
                 └────────┬─────────┘
                          │
                 ┌────────▼─────────┐
                 │ Integration Tests│
                 └────────┬─────────┘
                          │
                 ┌────────▼─────────┐
                 │ REST API Tests   │
                 └────────┬─────────┘
                          │
                 ┌────────▼─────────┐
                 │  Kafka / Events  │
                 └────────┬─────────┘
                          │
                 ┌────────▼─────────┐
                 │   k6 E2E Load    │
                 │      Tests       │
                 └──────────────────┘
```

The k6 test is particularly useful for validating the complete distributed flow rather than testing individual endpoints in isolation.

---

### Running Locally

The platform is designed to run locally using Docker Compose.

Infrastructure includes:

```text
PostgreSQL
Kafka
Kafka UI
Microservices
YARP Gateway
```

After starting the environment, the gateway can be used as the main entry point for API requests.

---

### Design Goals

The project focuses on practical microservice architecture rather than simply splitting a monolith into multiple applications.

Key goals include:

- clear service boundaries
- domain-oriented architecture
- asynchronous communication
- eventual consistency
- independent persistence
- REST APIs for synchronous operations
- Kafka events for integration
- resilient asynchronous workflows
- end-to-end business flow testing
- load testing of distributed workflows
- detection of financial discrepancies
- independent scalability of services

---

### Architecture Highlights

The project demonstrates several real-world distributed system problems.

**Eventual consistency**

After confirming a delivery, the payment may not exist immediately.

The client/test therefore waits until the corresponding asynchronous event has been processed.

```text
Confirm Delivery
      │
      ▼
   Kafka
      │
      ▼
Payment Created
```

**Distributed workflow**

Completing a delivery triggers additional processing in other services.

```text
Delivery
   │
   ├──► Payment
   │
   ├──► Ledger
   │
   └──► Reconciliation
```

## Outbox Pattern

The system uses the **Transactional Outbox Pattern** to reliably publish domain events to Kafka.

### Problem

Without the Outbox Pattern, updating business data and publishing an event to Kafka would be two independent operations:

```text
Database transaction
        |
        +---- save business data
        |
        +---- publish event to Kafka
```

This can lead to inconsistencies:

* business data is committed, but publishing to Kafka fails,
* the event is published, but the database transaction is rolled back,
* the application crashes between the database update and event publication.

The Outbox Pattern solves this by storing the event in the database as part of the **same transaction** as the business operation.

### Architecture

```text
                    Database
                 ┌─────────────┐
                 │ Business    │
                 │ tables      │
                 │             │
                 │ outbox_     │
                 │ messages    │
                 └──────┬──────┘
                        │
                 scheduled worker
                        │
                        ▼
                 ┌─────────────┐
                 │ Outbox      │
                 │ Publisher   │
                 └──────┬──────┘
                        │
                        ▼
                    ┌───────┐
                    │ Kafka │
                    └───────┘
```

During a business operation, the domain event is stored in `outbox_messages` within the same database transaction:

```text
BEGIN

    UPDATE payment ...

    INSERT INTO outbox_messages (...)

COMMIT
```

If the transaction is rolled back, both the business change and the event are rolled back.

If the transaction succeeds, the event remains in the Outbox and can be published asynchronously by the Outbox Publisher.

---

## Outbox Message Lifecycle

Each Outbox message has a status describing its current state:

```text
PENDING
   │
   │ publish succeeded
   ▼
PUBLISHED

PENDING
   │
   │ publish failed
   ▼
PENDING
   │
   │ maximum attempts reached
   ▼
DEAD
```

An Outbox message typically contains:

* `id` — unique identifier of the Outbox message,
* `event_id` — identifier of the domain event,
* `event_type` — event type,
* `aggregate_id` — identifier of the affected aggregate,
* `payload` — serialized event payload,
* `status` — current message status,
* `attempts` — number of publication attempts,
* `next_attempt_at` — earliest time when the next attempt can be made,
* `locked_until` — expiration time of the worker lease,
* `created_at` — message creation timestamp,
* `published_at` — successful publication timestamp.

---

## Claiming Messages with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`

The Outbox Publisher does not simply select pending messages:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM outbox_messages
WHERE status = 'PENDING'
LIMIT 50;
```

With multiple application instances, this could cause several publishers to select the same messages.

Instead, messages are claimed using:

```sql
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

The implementation uses a single PostgreSQL query:

```sql
UPDATE outbox_messages
SET locked_until = :lockedUntil
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM outbox_messages
    WHERE status = 'PENDING'
      AND next_attempt_at <= :now
      AND (
          locked_until IS NULL
          OR locked_until < :now
      )
    ORDER BY created_at
    FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
    LIMIT :limit
)
RETURNING *;
```

### How `SKIP LOCKED` works

Assume that two application instances are running the Outbox Publisher:

```text
                 outbox_messages
                ┌─────┬─────────┐
                │ ID  │ STATUS  │
                ├─────┼─────────┤
                │ A   │ PENDING │
                │ B   │ PENDING │
                │ C   │ PENDING │
                │ D   │ PENDING │
                └─────┴─────────┘

          ┌──────────────┐
          │ Publisher #1 │
          └──────┬───────┘
                 │
             locks A, B
                 │
                 ▼

          ┌──────────────┐
          │ Publisher #2 │
          └──────┬───────┘
                 │
          SKIP A, B
                 │
             claims C, D
                 ▼
```

The first publisher locks rows using `FOR UPDATE`.

When the second publisher encounters already locked rows, it **does not wait** for those locks to be released. `SKIP LOCKED` causes it to skip those rows and claim other available messages.

This allows multiple application instances to process the Outbox concurrently:

```text
Publisher #1 ──► A B C
Publisher #2 ──► D E F
Publisher #3 ──► G H I
```

without requiring a separate distributed lock.

---

## Application-Level Lease

`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` protects the claim operation while the database transaction is active.

However, the SQL row lock is released when the transaction ends.

For this reason, the Outbox also uses:

```text
locked_until
```

This represents an **application-level lease**.

When a message is claimed:

```text
locked_until = now + lease duration
```

Another publisher can only claim the message after the lease expires:

```sql
locked_until IS NULL
OR locked_until < :now
```

This is useful when:

* multiple application instances are running,
* publishing takes longer than expected,
* a worker crashes,
* the application is restarted,
* Kafka becomes temporarily unavailable.

If a worker crashes after claiming a message, the lease eventually expires and another worker can claim the message again.

---

## Publishing to Kafka

After claiming the messages, `OutboxPublisher` passes each message to the `EventPublisher`.

The Kafka implementation uses `KafkaTemplate` and `ProducerRecord`:

```text
OutboxMessage
     │
     ▼
KafkaEventPublisher
     │
     ▼
ProducerRecord
     │
     ▼
Kafka
```

The event is published together with metadata stored in Kafka headers:

```text
event-id
event-type
event-version
occurred-at
```

For example:

```text
event-id:       8d7...
event-type:     PaymentCompleted
event-version:  1
occurred-at:    2026-08-24T16:30:00Z
```

The `event-id` allows consumers to uniquely identify a particular event and can be used for idempotency and deduplication.

---

## Retry and Exponential Backoff

A failed publication is not retried immediately.

After a failure, the message is updated with:

```text
attempts++
next_attempt_at = now + backoff
last_error = exception
```

The publisher uses exponential backoff with a maximum delay.

The current implementation starts with a 5-second base delay:

```text
attempt 1 → 10 seconds
attempt 2 → 20 seconds
attempt 3 → 40 seconds
```

The delay is capped by `MAX_BACKOFF_SECONDS`.

This prevents the application from continuously retrying failed Kafka operations in a tight loop.

---

## Dead Messages

After reaching the maximum number of attempts, the message is marked as:

```text
DEAD
```

The lifecycle becomes:

```text
PENDING
   │
   ├── attempt 1 ──► failed
   │
   ├── attempt 2 ──► failed
   │
   └── attempt 3 ──► DEAD
```

The message remains in the database together with information about the failure:

```text
attempts
last_error
```

This makes failed events available for investigation and potential manual recovery.

---

## Scheduled Publisher

Publishing is performed periodically using Spring Scheduler:

```kotlin
@Scheduled(
    fixedDelayString = "\${delivery.outbox.publish-interval-ms:1000}"
)
fun publishPending()
```

Messages are processed in batches:

```text
BATCH_SIZE = 50
```

The publisher first claims a batch and then processes each message independently:

```text
              Outbox Publisher
                     │
              claim max 50
                     │
        ┌────────────┼────────────┐
        ▼            ▼            ▼
      Event A      Event B      Event C
        │            │            │
      Kafka        Kafka        Kafka
        │            │            │
        ▼            ▼            ▼
   PUBLISHED     PUBLISHED      FAILED
```

---

## Multiple Application Instances

The Outbox implementation is designed to work with multiple application instances:

```text
                  PostgreSQL
                      │
             outbox_messages
                      │
       ┌──────────────┼──────────────┐
       │              │              │
       ▼              ▼              ▼
 Publisher #1    Publisher #2    Publisher #3
       │              │              │
       └──────────────┼──────────────┘
                      ▼
                    Kafka
```

`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` allows the database table to act as a concurrent work queue.

Each publisher can claim its own set of messages without waiting for messages currently being processed by another instance.

---

## At-Least-Once Delivery

The Outbox Pattern provides **at-least-once delivery**, not exactly-once delivery.

For example, the following situation is possible:

```text
1. Worker claims the event
2. Worker publishes the event to Kafka
3. Kafka accepts the event
4. Worker fails before marking the event as PUBLISHED
5. Worker is restarted
6. The event becomes available again
7. The event is published again
```

As a result, consumers must be **idempotent**.

The `event-id` can be used as a deduplication key:

```text
event-id
    │
    ▼
consumer inbox / processed_events
    │
    ├── already processed → ignore
    │
    └── new event → process
```

The Outbox guarantees that an event is not lost between the business transaction and the broker publication. Handling potential duplicates is the responsibility of the consumer.

---

## Summary

The implementation combines several mechanisms:

| Mechanism            | Purpose                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Transactional Outbox | Atomically persist business data and events       |
| `FOR UPDATE`         | Safely claim messages                             |
| `SKIP LOCKED`        | Allow concurrent processing by multiple instances |
| `locked_until`       | Application-level lease for claimed messages      |
| Batch processing     | Limit the number of messages processed at once    |
| Exponential backoff  | Handle temporary failures                         |
| `DEAD` status        | Isolate messages that cannot be published         |
| Kafka headers        | Transport event metadata                          |
| `event-id`           | Identify and deduplicate events                   |
| Idempotent consumers | Safely handle at-least-once delivery              |

This approach provides reliable event delivery while allowing the Outbox Publisher to scale horizontally across multiple application instances.


## Idempotent Event Consumption

Because the Outbox Pattern provides **at-least-once delivery**, the same event may occasionally be delivered to a consumer more than once.

To prevent duplicate processing, consumers use a `processed_events` table to keep track of events that have already been successfully processed.

```sql
CREATE TABLE processed_events (
    event_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    event_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    processed_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL
);
```

The `event_id` is the unique identifier of the event and is used as the primary key.

### Consumer Flow

Before processing an incoming event, the consumer checks whether its `event_id` already exists in `processed_events`:

```text
                     Kafka Event
                          │
                          ▼
                ┌──────────────────┐
                │ Check event_id   │
                │ in processed_    │
                │ events           │
                └────────┬─────────┘
                         │
              ┌──────────┴──────────┐
              │                     │
        event exists           event not found
              │                     │
              ▼                     ▼
        Ignore event          Process event
                                      │
                                      ▼
                             Insert event_id
                             into processed_events
```

If the event already exists, the consumer treats it as a duplicate and does not execute the business operation again.

If the event does not exist, the consumer processes the event and records its `event_id` in `processed_events`.

### Example

The first delivery of an event:

```text
event-id = 8d7...
```

The consumer does not find the ID in `processed_events`:

```text
processed_events
┌───────────┬────────────┬─────────────────────┐
│ event_id  │ event_type │ processed_at        │
├───────────┼────────────┼─────────────────────┤
│           │            │                     │
└───────────┴────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

The event is processed and recorded:

```sql
INSERT INTO processed_events (
    event_id,
    event_type,
    processed_at
)
VALUES (
    :eventId,
    :eventType,
    :processedAt
);
```

If Kafka delivers the same event again:

```text
event-id = 8d7...
```

the consumer finds the existing record:

```text
event_id already exists
        │
        ▼
   skip processing
```

This prevents the business operation from being executed twice.

### Why `event_id` is the Primary Key

Using `event_id` as the primary key provides database-level protection against duplicate registrations of the same event.

Even if multiple consumer executions race with each other, the database guarantees that only one record for a given `event_id` can exist.

```text
event_id = 8d7...
     │
     ├── Consumer #1 ──► INSERT ──► success
     │
     └── Consumer #2 ──► INSERT ──► duplicate / already processed
```

The `processed_events` table therefore acts as a lightweight **Inbox / Processed Events** mechanism on the consumer side.

Combined with the Outbox Pattern, the overall messaging model is:

```text
┌──────────────┐
│ Business     │
│ Transaction  │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Outbox       │
│ Pattern      │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│    Kafka     │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ Consumer     │
│              │
│ Check        │
│ event_id     │
└──────┬───────┘
       │
       ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ processed_   │
│ events       │
└──────────────┘
```

This gives the system reliable **at-least-once delivery with idempotent processing**.

> **Important:** The business operation and the `processed_events` insert should be performed within the same database transaction. This prevents the consumer from marking an event as processed when the actual business operation has failed.
